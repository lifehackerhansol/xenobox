m3dec/m3patch v1a
These are applications compatible with M3R_iTDS_PP2, which enables to boot M3 firmwares on any clones.

m3dec: M3 firmware header is encrypted. This decrypts it (and reencrypts for your cart, if you want).
m3patch: M3 firmware check the cart by sending SPI 0xCD command. With m3p patch file this interrupts that.

m3p patch files are credited to Rudolph/mimic.
iTDSeng_enc.m3p/iTDSgb_enc.m3p is credited to The Pink Cat Boy.

Known header encryption keys:
M3Real jp : 0x07
M3Real eng: 0x12
M3Real gb : 0x23
iTouch jp : 0x37
iTouch eng: 0x32
iTouch gb : 0x33
R4iRTS    : 0x72

Of course if you want to decrypt to iSakuReal format, specify 0 for reencrypt key in m3dec.
