m3sakura_make; to change dsbooter into normal nds
dsbize; to change normal nds into dsbooter (to replace g6dsload.eng)

[m3sakura_make]
v2.100506 Written from scratch. Faster than Rudolph's version.
v2a.100506 m3dec integrated. Header is decrypted automatically.
v3.100507 Now m3sakura_make doesn't require ndstool (makes pseudo-normal header itself)
v3.100508 forgot to free file buffer. Padding is no longer added to code size.
v3a.100728 tmp.7/9 won't have padding.
v4.100924 Now puts correct header CRC16.

[dsbize]
v1.100508 You can replace g6dsload.eng with [high limitations]. <- due to VRAM initialization?

bin/TouchPod.nds: M3 extlink loader (TPLoad in normal header)
bin/misakura.nds: iSakuReal 1.12+a DLDI with fatpatch (updated in v3a) this uses startnds.eng, not .ext
                  (flashcarts other than M3 can use the GUI)
bin/g003_misakura.nds: iSakuReal 1.12+G for GMP-Z003. Use with system/Gset_*.eng.

g6dsload.eng: When put in /system, it will redirect to /moonshl2/reload.dat (You can change by binary hack)
Please get from mshl2tools package(reset_mse)
